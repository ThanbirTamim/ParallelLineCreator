## About The Project
This project will help you to get parallel line of a given line. To solve it, I've gather few code which was written 
in python from StakeOverFlow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65654982/offset-a-line-vector-parallel-to-given-lines)
and Converted into C#.
Check It Out And Happy Coding!!! 
:-)
